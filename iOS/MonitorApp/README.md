# Monitoring Session Sample App

The ARRIVE SDK delivers reliable arrival prediction. Battle-tested by millions of customer arrivals in real world commerce, ARRIVE sends an accurate alert before arrival and gives you true visibility into customer ETA and dwell time. ARRIVE hooks easily into mobile commerce infrastructure and on-site apps or POS for notifications.

This sample app integrates with the ARRIVE SDK. It is an example of a monitor app that demonstrates the ability of ARRIVE to accurately detect not only where a user is, but when the user is about to arrive.
