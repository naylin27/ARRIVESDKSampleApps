# User Session Sample App

The ARRIVE SDK delivers reliable arrival prediction. Battle-tested by millions of customer arrivals in real world commerce, ARRIVE sends an accurate alert before arrival and gives you true visibility into customer ETA and dwell time. ARRIVE hooks easily into mobile commerce infrastructure and on-site apps or POS for notifications.

This sample app demonstrates how to integrate the ARRIVE SDK with an Android app using the Java Programming Language. Run the sample app on a device before doing a drive test.
